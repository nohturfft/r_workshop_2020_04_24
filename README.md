## Preparation for the workshop  

### Expected background knowledge  

1. This will be a beginners/improvers workshop that builds on a [previous beginners workshop](https://github.com/nohturfft/r_workshop_2019_11_29) held in November last year. You are strongly encouraged to briefly review the material covered during the previous workshop.  
2. We will be working with scripts written in [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/); you might find it useful to familiarise yourself with this format if you haven't used it before. Consider downloading the [Rmarkdown cheat sheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) as a handy reference.  


### Install R and RStudio  

If you haven't already done so, [install first R](https://www.r-project.org/), then [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) on your computer. That way you can try out the code we'll cover during the practice breaks. Of course, you may choose to just follow the presentation.  

### Install packages  

We will be using a number of different R packages.  
Please install these by running the following code from the command prompt (note: _**tidyverse includes 26 packages in total; so the installation may take a few minutes**_):  

```
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("rmarkdown")
install.packages("knitr")
install.packages("DT")
```

Alternatively, you can install packages using the RStudio `Tools > Install Packages...` menu.
